      "Matthew S. Stated that when people say \"We believe marriage is between a man and a woman.\" think that gays are not citizens. I then returned a question saying \"if someone if 6 and can't marry are they going to 'not be citizens' as well?\". The logic behind that question is not to say that gays are 6 year olds but rather that gays are citizens just like a 6 yr old even if both can't marry. In other words, marriage doesn't make you a citizen or not...unless you think 6yr olds are citizens as well. Trying to make it seem like I made a statement out of a question is foolish and should be avoided.\n",
